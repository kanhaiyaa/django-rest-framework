    "### Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication is the mechanism of associating an incoming request with a set of identifying credentials, such as the user the request came from, or the token that it was signed with. \n",
    "\n",
    "The permission and throttling policies can then use those credentials to determine if the request should be permitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication is always run at the very start of the view, before the permission and throttling checks occur, and before any other code is allowed to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The request.user property will typically be set to an instance of the contrib.auth package's User class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The request.auth property is used for any additional authentication information, for example, it may be used to represent an authentication token that the request was signed with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget that **authentication by itself won't allow or disallow an incoming request, it simply identifies the credentials that the request was made with**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How authentication is determined\n",
    "The authentication schemes are always defined as a list of classes. REST framework will attempt to authenticate with each class in the list, and will set request.user and request.auth using the return value of the first class that successfully authenticates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no class authenticates, request.user will be set to an instance of django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser, and request.auth will be set to None.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of request.user and request.auth for unauthenticated requests can be modified using the UNAUTHENTICATED_USER and UNAUTHENTICATED_TOKEN settings."

    "## Object level permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning. Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object level permissions are run by REST framework's generic views when .get_object() is called. As with view level permissions, an exceptions.PermissionDenied exception will be raised if the user is not allowed to act on the given object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're writing your own views and want to enforce object level permissions, or if you override the get_object method on a generic view, then you'll need to explicitly call the .check_object_permissions(request, obj) method on the view at the point at which you've retrieved the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will either raise a PermissionDenied or NotAuthenticated exception, or simply return if the view has the appropriate permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of object level permissions\n",
    "For performance reasons the generic views will not automatically apply object level permissions to each instance in a queryset when returning a list of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when you're using object level permissions you'll also want to filter the queryset appropriately, to ensure that users only have visibility onto instances that they are permitted to view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default permission policy may be set globally, using the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also set the authentication policy on a per-view, or per-viewset basis, using the APIView class-based views or @api_view function based views.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Types of Permissions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/#api-reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. AllowAny\n",
    "\n",
    "The AllowAny permission class will allow unrestricted access, regardless of if the request was authenticated or unauthenticated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This permission is not strictly required, since you can achieve the same result by using an empty list or tuple for the permissions setting, but you may find it useful to specify this class because it makes the intention explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. IsAuthenticated\n",
    "The IsAuthenticated permission class will deny permission to any unauthenticated user, and allow permission otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This permission is suitable if you want your API to only be accessible to registered users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. IsAdminUser\n",
    "The IsAdminUser permission class will deny permission to any user, unless user.is_staff is True in which case permission will be allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This permission is suitable if you want your API to only be accessible to a subset of trusted administrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly\n",
    "The IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly will allow authenticated users to perform any request. Requests for unauthorised users will only be permitted if the request method is one of the \"safe\" methods; GET, HEAD or OPTIONS.\n",
    "\n",
    "This permission is suitable if you want to your API to allow read permissions to anonymous users, and only allow write permissions to authenticated users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. DjangoModelPermissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorization will only be granted if the user is authenticated and has the relevant model permissions assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This permission class ties into Django's standard django.contrib.auth model permissions. This permission must only be applied to views that have a .queryset property set. \n",
    "\n",
    "POST requests require the user to have the add permission on the model.\n",
    "PUT and PATCH requests require the user to have the change permission on the model.\n",
    "DELETE requests require the user to have the delete permission on the model.\n",
    "The default behaviour can also be overridden to support custom model permissions. For example, you might want to include a view model permission for GET requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use custom model permissions, override DjangoModelPermissions and set the .perms_map property. Refer to the source code for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using with views that do not include a queryset attribute.\n",
    "If you're using this permission with a view that uses an overridden get_queryset() method there may not be a queryset attribute on the view. In this case we suggest also marking the view with a sentinel queryset, so that this class can determine the required permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to DjangoModelPermissions, but also allows unauthenticated users to have read-only access to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This permission class ties into Django's standard object permissions framework that allows per-object permissions on models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Custom permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a custom permission, override BasePermission and implement either, or both, of the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- .has_permission(self, request, view)\n",
    "- .has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj)\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods should return True if the request should be granted access, and False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to test if a request is a read operation or a write operation, you should check the request method against the constant SAFE_METHODS, which is a tuple containing 'GET', 'OPTIONS' and 'HEAD'. For example:"

    "\n",
    "The UserRateThrottle will throttle users to a given rate of requests across the API. The user id is used to generate a unique key to throttle against. Unauthenticated requests will fall back to using the IP address of the incoming request to generate a unique key to throttle against.\n",
